<h1 align="center">About the course</h1>

In the [final course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-science-capstone) of [Advanced Data Science with IBM Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm) hosted on Coursera platform, a data science project allows learners to be as creative as they want and come up with an idea to leverage the power of deep learning algorithms to analyse data.

Main Jupyter notebook for the project is located here: https://github.com/YuryChebiryak/IBM_advanced_data_science/blob/master/capstone/SeattleHousing.data_exp.ipynb
